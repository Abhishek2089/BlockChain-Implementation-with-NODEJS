 Building the blockchain class with its required functionality.
 Accessing the blockchain with express API.
 Creating a decentralized blockchain network.
 Synchronizing the entire network.
 Create Consensus Algorithm.
 Building Block Explorer (UI tool to view blockchain data) etc..
 Running the APP locally

 Prerequisites

 NodeJS: Please install NodeJS >= 10.15.0. If you already have it, you're good to go.

 Once you have the Prerequisites covered:

 Clone this repository from GitHub onto your local computer.
 git clone https://github.com/Abhishek2089/BlockChain-Implementation-with-NODEJS.git
 Navigate into the project folder and install all of its necessary dependencies.
 cd node-blockchain
 Start the server
 This will start the decentralized network on ports 3001 - 3006. Visit each node at these urls.
 http://localhost:3001/
 http://localhost:3002/
 http://localhost:3003/
 http://localhost:3004/
 http://localhost:3005/
 http://localhost:3006/
